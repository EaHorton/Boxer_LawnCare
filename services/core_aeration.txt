Core Aeration

Core aeration is a highly beneficial lawn care practice that involves removing small plugs of soil from your lawn to allow air, water, and nutrients to reach the root zone more effectively. This process helps alleviate soil compaction, which can limit root growth and prevent proper water drainage.

The benefits of core aeration include:

Improved Root Growth: With increased access to air and nutrients, your grass roots can grow deeper and stronger, leading to a healthier lawn.

Enhanced Soil Drainage: Aeration helps break up compacted soil, allowing water to penetrate more efficiently, reducing the risk of water pooling or runoff.

Better Fertilizer Absorption: Aerating your lawn allows fertilizers and other treatments to penetrate deeper into the soil, making them more effective.

Reduced Thatch Buildup: By promoting better soil health, aeration helps prevent thatch buildup, which can choke grass and foster harmful pests or disease.

Increased Turf Resilience: A well-aerated lawn is more resilient to drought, high traffic, and other stressors, ensuring it remains lush and vibrant throughout the year.

Overall, core aeration is a key step in maintaining a strong, healthy, and thriving lawn, ensuring it has the right conditions to flourish.
