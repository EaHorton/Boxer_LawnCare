This process helps alleviate soil compaction, which can limit root growth and prevent proper water drainage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The benefits of core aeration include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Improved Root Growth: With increased access to air and nutrients, your grass roots can grow deeper and stronger, leading to a healthier lawn.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
